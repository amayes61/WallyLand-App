#### Paragraph ####

During this implementation of Use Case 1 we were able to accomplish the initial buildout and design of the application using Scene Builder in Netbeans. We were able to get the Activity Use Case completed. Some things that we were able to complete was getting the application to display all activities that are available. Along with allowing the user that logs in to be able to select the activity they would like. Then in the drop-down menu if you select Scheduled Activities, the user is able to see the activity that they scheduled. Also when you go back to the Available Activities page the activity they selected is no longer shown. A bug we are still working on is the Signin page, where the user can input their name, we are currently debugging trying to get to where the user input will then be displayed throughout the application. This is more of a cosmetic problem. But overall we were able to accomplish the goal of developing the Use Case code for Activity planning.
